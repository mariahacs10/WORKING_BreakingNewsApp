I wanted to know how do i get a image placeholder to display when there isn't a image for the article, its honestly
very simple. Here are the Steps on how to do that

Step 1. in the BreakingNews Repository Go into the CoilImage and in there do this:

@OptIn(ExperimentalCoilApi::class)
@Composable
fun CoilImage(imageUrl: String, contentDescription: String?, modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {

    val imageModel = if(imageUrl.isEmpty()) {
        painterResource(com.example.breakingnewsapp.R.drawable.noimagefound)
    } else {
        rememberImagePainter(imageUrl)
    }

    Image(
        painter = imageModel,
        contentDescription = contentDescription,
        modifier = modifier
    )
}

Step 2. Dont forget to add your dependincie:

    implementation("io.coil-kt:coil-compose:1.3.0")


Step 3.And Also in the Manifest you want to add this:

        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"

-------------------------------------------------------------------

(you will NOT have to change anything in the savednews or search news because your using the coilimage in the breaking news, and since
searchnews and savednews are based on the breakingnews coilimage you wont have to change any code inside those composables)
