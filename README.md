First jetpack compose App!

This was my first ever app i did in jetpack compose kotlin, I did NOT use ANY videos i solved ALL my error by myself, 
this is a spin off of the video i followed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asuOWE5KuFM&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCRF8XiCRESq1IFFW8COlxYJ, That video is using views and i wanted to create
that project in jetpack compose.

I've created thorough notes and commented out my code so its nice and neat, The biggest issues i had where the room database, bottom navigation, and getting the composable clickable
i cover everything i did in the notes.

I am pretty proud of myself for completing this!.

little side note add the api key inside the local.properties file:NEWS_API_KEY=b224ce1a795743bca3deb3d5f8dc30b2
